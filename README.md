# [Selected Stories](https://cvalenzuela.github.io/Selected_Stories/)

An experimental web text editor that runs a LSTM model while you write to suggest new lines. You can switch between different pretrained models.

Everything runs in the browser using [deeplearn.js](https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs) and [p5ml](https://github.com/ITPNYU/p5-deeplearn-js).
